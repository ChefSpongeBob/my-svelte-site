    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      I’m a Microsoft-certified full-stack developer with a strong foundation in
      front-end and back-end development, complemented by Google and CompTIA
      cybersecurity certifications. My professional background includes
      three years working within the Fraud & Digital department of a large
      credit union, where system integrity, security, and operational reliability
      were critical at scale.

    <h2>What I Build</h2>
    <p>
      My work focuses on designing and implementing complete systems rather than
      isolated components. This includes application development, IoT systems
      architecture, secure data transfer and storage, and software that interfaces
      directly with physical devices through gateways and distributed nodes.
    </p>

  <div class="about-section">
    <h2>Hardware & Systems Integration</h2>
    <p>
      Beyond software, I work with embedded hardware, development boards,
      robotics, and localized system architecture. I also utilize 3D printing
      and small-scale production to prototype and manufacture physical components,
      allowing digital systems to extend seamlessly into the physical world.

    Charlotte’s Web Nexus exists to design systems that are practical,
    secure, and built to last—combining thoughtful architecture with hands-on
    implementation from concept through deployment.
